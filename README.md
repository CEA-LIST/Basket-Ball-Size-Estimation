# DeepSportRadar Ball 3D localization challenge

One of the [ACM MMSports 2022 Workshop](http://mmsports.multimedia-computing.de/mmsports2022/index.html) challenges. An opportunity to publish or win a $1000,00 prize. See [this page](http://mmsports.multimedia-computing.de/mmsports2022/challenge.html) for more details.

This challenge tackles the estimation of ball size on basketball scenes. Using camera calibration information and knowledge of the real ball size, this estimation can be used to recover the ball 3d localization in the scene[^1].

## Challenge rules

Please refer to the challenge webpage for complete rules, timelines and awards: [https://deepsportradar.github.io/challenge.html](https://deepsportradar.github.io/challenge.html).

The goal of this challenge is to obtain the best estimation of ball size in pixels from thumbnails around true ball positions. The metric used will be the mean absolute error (MAE) between the prediction and the ground-truth.
Contestants will be evaluated on a **challenge-set** that will be provided later and for which labels will be kept secrets.

The competitors must conceive a model that relies only on the provided data for training. In the case of a neural-network based model, initial weights may come from a well-established public methods pret-trained on public data. This must be clearly stated in the publication/report.

## Downloading the dataset

The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepsportradar/basketball-instants-dataset) and unzipped manually in the `basketball-instants-dataset/` folder of the project. To do it programmatically, you need the kaggle CLI:

```bash
pip install kaggle
```

Go to your Kaggle Account settings page and click on `Create new API Token` to download the file to be saved as `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` for authentication. Finally download and unzip the dataset with:

```bash
kaggle datasets download deepsportradar/basketball-instants-dataset
unzip -qo ./basketball-instants-dataset.zip -d basketball-instants-dataset
```

## Using deepsport repository

This challenge is based on the public https://github.com/gabriel-vanzandycke/deepsport repository which will serve as a baseline.
Follow the `deepsport` repository installation instructions and add the folder `basketball-instants-dataset` full path to `DATA_PATH` in your `.env` file.

### Create the ball dataset

The `deepsport` repository comes with helpers to create the ball dataset from the `basketball-instants-dataset`:
```bash
python deepsport/scripts/prepare_ball_views_dataset.py --dataset-folder basketball-instants-dataset
```

The file generated (`basketball-instants-dataset/ball_views.pickle`) is an `mlworkflow.PickledDataset` whose items have the following attributes:
- `image`: a `numpy.ndarray` RGB image thumbnail centered on the ball.
- `calib`: a [`Calib`](https://ispgroupucl.github.io/calib3d/calib3d/calib.html#implementation) object describing the calibration data associated to `image` using the [Keemotion convention](https://gitlab.com/deepsport/deepsport_utilities/-/blob/main/calibration.md#working-with-calibrated-images-captured-by-the-keemotion-system).
- `ball` : a [`BallAnnotation`](https://gitlab.com/deepsport/deepsport_utilities/-/blob/main/deepsport_utilities/ds/instants_dataset/instants_dataset.py#L264) object with attributes:
  - `center`: the ball 3D position as a [`calib3d.Point3D`](https://ispgroupucl.github.io/calib3d/calib3d/points.html) object (use `calib.project_3D_to_2D(ball.center)` to retrieve pixel coordinates).
  - `visible`: a flag telling if ball is visible.

You can visualize this dataset the following way:
```python
from mlworkflow import PickledDataset
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
ds = PickledDataset("basketball-instants-dataset/ball_views.pickle")
for key in ds.keys:
    item = ds.query_item(key)
    plt.imshow(item.image)
    plt.title("ball size: {:.1f}".format(item.calib.compute_length2D(23, item.ball.center)[0]))
    plt.show()
    break # avoid looping through all dataset
```

### Dataset splits

The `deepsport` repository uses the split defined by [`DeepSportDatasetSplitter`](https://gitlab.com/deepsport/deepsport_utilities/-/blob/main/deepsport_utilities/ds/instants_dataset/dataset_splitters.py#L6) which
1. Uses images from `KS-FR-CAEN`, `KS-FR-LIMOGES` and `KS-FR-ROANNE` arenas for the **testing-set**.
2. Randomly samples 15% of the remaining images for the **validation-set**
3. Uses the remaining images for the **training-set**.

The **testing-set** should be used to evaluate your method, both on the public EvalAI leaderboard that provides the temporary ranking, and when communicating about your method.
The **challenge-set** doesnâ€™t contain any image from the three sets defined above. You are free to use them all to build the model that 

### Running the baseline
```bash
python -m experimentator configs/ballsize.py --epochs 101 --kwargs "eval_epochs=range(0,101,20)"
```
You can vizualize the metrics the following way:

```python
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from experimentator import DataCollector
dc = DataCollector("/home/gva/deepsport/results/ballsize/20220321_170013.798212/history.dcp")
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2,1)
for ax, metric in zip(axes, ["loss", "MADE"]):
    for subset in ["training", "validation"]:
        label = f"{subset}_{metric}"
        l = np.array(dc[label, :])
        w = np.where(l)[0]
        ax.plot(w, l[w], label=label)
    ax.legend()
```

## Challenge
Given a dataset of ball thumbnails and ground-truth ball diameter in pixels, you are asked to create a model that predicts ball diameter on unseen images of balls.
