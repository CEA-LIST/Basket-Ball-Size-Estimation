# DeepSportRadar - Ball 3D localization challenge

This is the development toolkit for the DeepSportRadar ball 3D localization challenge. In this repository, you will find code to use the provided dataset, run a baseline, evaluate it and submit your predictions to the official leaderboard. A $ 1000.00 price dedicated to this challenge will be awarded to participants proposing the best approach.

## Context

The task consists in finding ball 3D localization from a single calibrated image. The most natural approach is to detect the ball and estimate its diameter in the image space, and then use calibration data and knowledge of real ball diameter in meters to compute the localization in the 3D space.
This approach is described in (Ball 3D Localization from single calibrated image)[!url]

## Challenge
Given a dataset of ball thumbnails and ground-truth ball diameter in pixels, you are asked to create a model that predicts ball diameter on unseen images of balls.

## Metric
The metric used is the Mean Absolute Error in pixels

## Baseline
