# DeepSportRadar Ball 3D localization challenge

One of the [ACM MMSports 2022 Workshop](http://mmsports.multimedia-computing.de/mmsports2022/index.html) challenges. An opportunity to publish or win a $1000,00 prize. See [this page](http://mmsports.multimedia-computing.de/mmsports2022/challenge.html) for more details.

This challenge tackles the estimation of ball size on basketball scenes. Using camera calibration information and knowledge of the real ball size, this estimation can be used to recover the ball 3d localization in the scene[^1].

## Challenge rules

Please refer to the challenge webpage for complete rules, timelines and awards: [https://deepsportradar.github.io/challenge.html](https://deepsportradar.github.io/challenge.html).

The goal is to obtain the best estimation of ball size in pixels on the *challenge*-set that will be provided later and for which labels will be kept secrets. The metric used will be the mean absolute error (MAE) between the prediction and the secret ground-truth.

The competitors must conceive a model that relies only on the provided data for training. In the case of a neural-network based model, initial weights may come from a well-established public methods pret-trained on public data. **This must be clearly stated in the publication/report**.

## Installation

### Downloading the dataset

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepsportradar/basketball-instants-dataset) and can be downloaded and unzipped manually in the `basketball-instants-dataset/` folder of the project. To do it programmatically, you need the kaggle CLI:

```bash
pip install kaggle
```

Go to your Kaggle Account settings page and click on `Create new API Token` to download the file to be saved as `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` for authentication. Finally download and unzip the dataset with:

```bash
kaggle datasets download deepsportradar/basketball-instants-dataset
unzip -qo ./basketball-instants-dataset.zip -d basketball-instants-dataset
```

### DeepSport datasets format

Our dataset follows the DeepSport datasets format, composed of a database stored in a json file and multiple data files. The easiest approach to load the data is to use the deepsport toolkit:
```bash
pip install deepsport-utilities
```

Our dataset can then be loaded with
```python
from deepsport_utilities import import_dataset
from deepsport_utilities.ds.instants_dataset import InstantsDataset

dataset_config = {
    "download_flags": 3, # corresponds to images and their calib
    "dataset_folder": "basketball-instants-dataset"  # path to dataset files
}

ds = import_dataset(InstantsDataset, "basketball-instants-dataset/basketball-instants-dataset.json", **dataset_config)
```

### Dataset splits

## Using deepsport repository

This challenge is based on the public https://github.com/gabriel-vanzandycke/deepsport repository which will serve as a baseline.
Follow the repository instructions to install it and add `basketball-instants-dataset` full path to `DATA_PATH` in your `.env` file.

### baseline

python -m experimentator configs/ballsize.py --epochs 101 --kwargs "eval_epochs=range(0,101,20)"

## Challenge
Given a dataset of ball thumbnails and ground-truth ball diameter in pixels, you are asked to create a model that predicts ball diameter on unseen images of balls.
